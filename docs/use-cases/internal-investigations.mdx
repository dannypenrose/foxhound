# Internal Investigations

Cross-reference communications between multiple parties to establish who knew what and when.

## The Problem

Internal investigations require tracing information flow across multiple people and communication channels. You need to build a timeline showing when key decisions were made, who was informed, and what was discussed.

## Workflow

### 1. Ingest All Relevant Sources

```bash
uv run python dedup.py
uv run python ingest.py --reset
```

### 2. Map the Communication Landscape

Use `explore.py` to understand who communicated and when:

```bash
# Full corpus overview
uv run python explore.py

# Focus on specific year
uv run python explore.py --year 2025

# Check specific individuals
uv run python explore.py --sender alice@company.com
uv run python explore.py --sender bob@company.com
```

### 3. Track Specific Communications

Search for communications between key individuals:

```bash
mkdir -p evidence

uv run python query.py \
  --sender "alice@company.com,bob@company.com" \
  --date-range 2025-01-01 2025-06-30 \
  --export-json evidence/alice-bob.json
```

### 4. Search for Key Topics

```bash
uv run python query.py \
  --semantic "approval authorisation sign-off decision" \
  --date-range 2025-01-01 2025-06-30 \
  --top-k 200 --export-json evidence/approvals.json

uv run python query.py \
  --semantic "risk warning concern escalation" \
  --date-range 2025-01-01 2025-06-30 \
  --top-k 200 --export-json evidence/warnings.json

uv run python query.py \
  --semantic "meeting minutes discussion agreed actions" \
  --source-type meeting_note \
  --top-k 200 --export-json evidence/meetings.json
```

### 5. Merge and Analyse

```bash
uv run python merge.py evidence/*.json --output evidence/merged.json

uv run python analyze.py evidence/merged.json \
  --full-pipeline \
  --context "Build a chronological timeline of key decisions, who was involved, and what information was available at each decision point" \
  --model deepseek
```

### 6. Export Timeline

```bash
uv run python export.py analysis_output.md --output investigation-timeline.md
```

## Tips

- Use `--date-range` to narrow the investigation window
- Combine `--sender` filters with `--semantic` to find specific topics discussed by specific people
- Meeting notes often contain the clearest record of decisions — filter with `--source-type meeting_note`
- For maximum privacy during investigation, use `--local` to keep all analysis on-machine
- Use `--read N` to inspect individual results in full before exporting
